[{"id":1,"name":"MacBook Pro 16\" M1 AZ35202 ","content":"After Apple launched its first-ever 16-inch MacBook Pro last year, there hasn’t been much word about its next iteration. Sure, there were new GPU and SSD configurations launched a few months ago but those can’t exactly be considered an upgrade, especially compared to the one that the 13-inch MacBook Pro got in May.\n\nWith Apple shuffling everyone towards its Apple Silicon, which is expected to debut in a new hardware line up next month, it seemed that the next 16-inch MacBook Pro will be part of that new family. The latest version of Apple’s Boot Camp utility, however, seems to suggest otherwise.\n\nThe changelog for version 6.1.13 of Boot Camp makes a reference to a 2020 model of the 16-inch MacBook Pro which, as mentioned, doesn’t exist yet, at least not officially. Even more interesting is what Boot Camp support for that model implies. Apple has confirmed that Boot Camp, its utility to dual boot Windows and macOS, won’t be available on Apple Silicon devices. That could only mean that this upcoming large MacBook will still be running on an Intel chip. \n","meta_description":"MacBook Pro 16\" M1 AZ35202 available now!","meta_title":"Best MacBook Pro 16\" M1 - THE FASTEST EVER","price":9999,"slug":"mac-book-pro-16-m1-az-35202","published_at":"2021-03-16T21:40:39.453Z","created_at":"2021-03-16T21:40:15.322Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T21:40:39.475Z","image":{"id":1,"name":"Zrzut ekranu 2021-03-16 o 22.38.35.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":2354,"height":1388,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Zrzut ekranu 2021-03-16 o 22.38.35.png","hash":"thumbnail_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":245,"height":144,"size":100.89,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76.png"},"large":{"name":"large_Zrzut ekranu 2021-03-16 o 22.38.35.png","hash":"large_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":1000,"height":590,"size":1271.62,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Zrzut ekranu 2021-03-16 o 22.38.35.png","hash":"medium_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":750,"height":442,"size":768.22,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76.png"},"small":{"name":"small_Zrzut ekranu 2021-03-16 o 22.38.35.png","hash":"small_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":295,"size":370.93,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76.png"}},"hash":"Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":3652.86,"url":"/uploads/Zrzut_ekranu_2021_03_16_o_22_38_35_5fcb292d76.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-03-16T21:38:42.541Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T21:38:42.559Z"}},{"id":2,"name":"MacBook Pro 13\" M1 AZ35201 ","content":"This year marked the introduction of the first Macs to be powered by Apple’s own silicon instead of Intel chips. As is evidenced by our reviews of the M1 MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, these machines are incredibly powerful and offer wicked fast performance. This is especially true for apps that are designed to run natively on them and take full advantage of Apple’s latest technologies.\n\nSo in that vein, this year’s Mac apps list is going to focus on some of the software that has already been optimized for this new era of Apple hardware. Last year’s picks remain just as relevant and useful today if you’re on an Intel machine. But if you’ve been gifted (or are gifting yourself) one of these new speed-demon Macs, these are a few great ways of sampling what they can do.\n\nWe’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for iPhones, Android phones, Windows PCs, and M1-equipped Macs; our favorite mobile games from Apple Arcade and Google Play Pass; and our top choices for gaming PCs, the PS5, Xbox One and Series X / S, Nintendo Switch, and VR. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus, and Netflix; some great sci-fi books; and exciting new podcasts.
